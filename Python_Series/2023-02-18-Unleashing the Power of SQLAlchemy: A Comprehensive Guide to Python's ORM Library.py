# SQLAlchemy is a powerful and flexible Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python.
# To get started with SQLAlchemy, you will first need to install it using pip: 
# pip install sqlalchemy > In terminal

# Once you have SQLAlchemy installed, you can start by creating a connection to your database. 
# For example, to connect to a SQLite database, you would use the following code:
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

engine = create_engine('sqlite:///mydatabase.db')

# With the connection established, you can now start interacting with the database. 
# Using the Core API, you can execute raw SQL statements, like so:
from sqlalchemy import text

result = engine.execute(text("SELECT * FROM mytable"))
print(result.fetchall())

# Alternatively, you can use the ORM API to work with database entities as Python objects. 
# First, you will need to define your entities using SQLAlchemy's declarative syntax:
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String

Base = declarative_base()

class MyEntity(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'mytable'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)

# With your entities defined, you can now create a session to start querying the database:
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()

entities = session.query(MyEntity).all()
print([entity.name for entity in entities])
