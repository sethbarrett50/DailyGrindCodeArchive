# PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library for Python that provides a set of tools for building and training neural networks.
# To get started with PyTorch, you will need to install it first. 
# You can do this by running the following command: 
# pip install torch > In Terminal

# Once PyTorch is installed, you can start building and training your own neural networks. 
# A simple example of building a neural network using PyTorch is shown below:
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class NeuralNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(NeuralNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.layer1 = nn.Linear(10, 20)
        self.layer2 = nn.Linear(20, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.sigmoid(self.layer1(x))
        x = torch.sigmoid(self.layer2(x))
        return x

model = NeuralNetwork()

# Once the model is defined, we can train it using the built-in PyTorch functions. 
# The following code snippet shows an example of how to train a model using PyTorch:
import torch.optim as optim

criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

for epoch in range(100):
    # Forward pass
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(outputs, labels)

    # Backward and optimize
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
