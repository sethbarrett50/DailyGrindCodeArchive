# A singly linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object, linked together using pointers. 
# Each element, or node, in a singly linked list consists of two fields: a data field to store the element, and a next field to store the reference to the next node in the list. 
# The nodes are linked in a sequential manner, such that the next field of each node points to the next node in the list.
# We can start by creating a Node class to represent each node in the linked list. 
# The Node class will have two instance variables: data to store the element, and next to store the reference to the next node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data=None):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

# Next, we can create a LinkedList class to represent the linked list itself. 
# This class will have a head instance variable to keep track of the first node in the list.
class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

# We can then add various methods to the LinkedList class to manipulate the list. 
# For example, we can add a method to add a new node to the list, a method to remove a node from the list, and a method to find a specific node in the list.
class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
