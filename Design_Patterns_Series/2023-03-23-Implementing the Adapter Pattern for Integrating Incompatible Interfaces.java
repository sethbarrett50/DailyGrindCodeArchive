// Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates the Adapter Pattern:


// Client interface
    interface WeatherService {
        public String[] getWeatherData();
    }
    
    // Incompatible interface
    class ThirdPartyWeatherService {
        public String[] getWeatherInfo() {
            // returns weather information in different format
        }
    }
    
    // Adapter class
    class ThirdPartyWeatherServiceAdapter implements WeatherService {
        private ThirdPartyWeatherService thirdPartyWeatherService;
        
        public ThirdPartyWeatherServiceAdapter(ThirdPartyWeatherService thirdPartyWeatherService) {
            this.thirdPartyWeatherService = thirdPartyWeatherService;
        }
        
        public String[] getWeatherData() {
            String[] weatherInfo = thirdPartyWeatherService.getWeatherInfo();
            // adapt the weather information to match the client interface
            return weatherInfo;
        }
    }
    
    // Client code
    public class Client {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            ThirdPartyWeatherService thirdPartyWeatherService = new ThirdPartyWeatherService();
            WeatherService weatherService = new ThirdPartyWeatherServiceAdapter(thirdPartyWeatherService);
            
            // use the weather service through the adapter
            String[] weatherData = weatherService.getWeatherData();
            // display the weather information on the client application
        }
    }
