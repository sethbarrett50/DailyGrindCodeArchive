; Here's an example of a simple CLIPS rule:
(defrule example-rule
(condition1)
(condition2)
=>
(action1)
(action2))

; Here's an example of a simple CLIPS template
(deftemplate person
(slot name)
(slot age)
(slot gender))

; In this example, the template "person" has three slots, name, age, and gender, that represent the attributes of a person. 
; To add a person to the knowledge base, you can use the "assert" statement, like this:
(assert (person (name "John") (age 30) (gender "Male")))

; Here's an example of a simple CLIPS function that calculates the average age of the people in the knowledge base:
(deffunction average-age ()
(let ((sum 0)
(count 0))
(do-for-all-facts ((?f person))
(bind ?sum (+ ?sum (send ?f get-slot-value age)))
(bind ?count (+ ?count 1)))
(/ ?sum ?count)))
