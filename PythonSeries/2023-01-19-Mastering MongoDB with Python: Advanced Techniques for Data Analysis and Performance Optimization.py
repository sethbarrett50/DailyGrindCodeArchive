# The PyMongo library provides a simple and convenient API for interacting with MongoDB databases. 
# You can use the MongoClient class to connect to a MongoDB instance, and the find() method to retrieve data from a collection. 
# For example:
from pymongo import MongoClient

client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
db = client['mydatabase']
collection = db['mycollection']

data = collection.find()
for document in data:
    print(document)

# Another commonly used function in PyMongo is insert_one() method to insert a single document in a collection. 
# For example:
from pymongo import MongoClient

client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
db = client['mydatabase']
collection = db['mycollection']

my_document = { "name": "John", "age": 30 }
collection.insert_one(my_document)

# Aggregation allows you to perform complex data processing and analysis on your data, using the MongoDB aggregation pipeline. 
# The aggregation pipeline is a powerful tool that allows you to perform a wide range of operations on your data, such as filtering, grouping, and sorting.
# For example, let's say you want to find the average age of all the documents in your collection:
from bson.son import SON

pipeline = [
    {"$group": {"_id": None, "average_age": {"$avg": "$age"}}}
]

result = collection.aggregate(pipeline)
print(list(result))

# Indexing allows you to create a special data structure that stores a copy of your data in a specific order, so that it can be retrieved quickly and efficiently. 
# You can create indexes on any field or combination of fields in your documents, and use them to optimize your queries.
# For example, let's say you want to create an index on the name field in your collection:
collection.create_index([("name", pymongo.ASCENDING)])
