# Poetry is a package manager and dependency management tool for Python projects
# Here is an example of how to use Poetry to manage dependencies in a python project:

# First, you'll need to install Poetry. You can do this by running:
'''pip install poetry > In Terminal'''

# Next, you'll need to create a new project. You can do this by running:
'''poetry new myproject > In Terminal'''

# This will create a new directory called myproject, with a basic file structure.

# Now, let's say you want to add a dependency to your project. You can do this by running:
'''poetry add requests > In Terminal'''

# This will add the requests library to your project, and it will also update your pyproject.toml file with the new dependency.

# Now, let's say you want to install your dependencies. You can do this by running:
'''poetry install > In Terminal'''

# This will install all of the dependencies listed in your pyproject.toml file.

# Finally, let's say you want to create a package of your project. You can do this by running:
'''poetry build > In Terminal'''

# This will create a package of your project, and it will also create a poetry.lock file.
